# implementation-notes.md — non-trivial choices, one clink at a time

Running log of the design decisions behind each ratchet advance that were *not* forced.
`AGENTS.md` says what the package is; this file says why the parts that could have gone
another way went the way they did. Newest last.

## Clink 1 (2026-08-31) — tier 2's remaining `send` rungs: 14 → 24

Rungs added: `cmp-lt`, `cmp-le`, `cmp-ge`, `not-expr`, `to-s-call`,
`unmodeled-builtin-zero-p`, `str-length`, `eq-same-type`, `eq-different-type`,
`nil-eq-nil` — plus `nested-arith`, which `chk` already answered but which had no hand
derivation on file. Tier 2 goes 6/20 → 16/20.

**Why exactly these ten and not all of tier 2.** The tier's two remaining non-negative
rungs are `bool-and` (`true && false`) and `bool-or`. Ruby's `&&`/`||` are *not* sends:
the desugarer emits

```
seq (vasgn local __dt_t1 (true)) (if (var local __dt_t1) (false) (var local __dt_t1))
```

— a temporary local, a `seq` and an `if`. So `&&` is a tier-3 + tier-4 construct wearing
a tier-2 costume, and typing it needs `Env`, which every rule's shape changes for. Left
for the next clink deliberately rather than smuggling in half an environment.

**The four new rule shapes, and what each one claims.** The interesting content of this
clink is entirely in `PrimSig`'s new rows; each is a different *kind* of assertion about
the semantics, which is why they are documented one at a time in `Judge.lean` rather than
as a table:

1. **Comparisons** (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` on `Integer`) — result `Bool`, argument still
   constrained to `.int`. The constraint is load-bearing in the same way `strAdd`'s is:
   `1 < "a"` raises `ArgumentError` ("comparison of Integer with String failed"), which
   is *inside* the NoMethodError/ArgumentError/TypeError family this ladder calls
   type-stuck. `>` is admitted with no rung asking for it, because the soundness
   argument for it is character-for-character `<`'s; that is the one place in this clink
   where a row is not rung-driven, and it is noted here so it is a choice rather than a
   drift.
2. **Nullary total queries** (`Integer#to_s`, `Integer#zero?`, `String#length`) —
   constrain the receiver, nothing else. `to_s` is *zero-arg only*: `5.to_s(2)` is legal
   Ruby with a different signature, and admitting `[.int]` there would have been a guess,
   so it is a negative control instead.
3. **`!`** — the point of the rung is syntactic, not semantic: `!true` desugars to
   `send (tru) "!" []`, an ordinary send with an empty argument list. So Ruby's unary
   operators need **no new `Expr` node and no new rule shape**, only a `PrimSig` row.
   Kept narrow to a `.bool` receiver even though `!` is total on *every* Ruby object,
   because the general rule needs `.any` on the receiver and no rung asks for it.
4. **`==`** — the first rule in this package that is **polymorphic in an argument type**.

**`EqSafe`: why `==` got a side condition instead of a wildcard.** `AGENTS.md` §Design
notes demands `Object#== : (any) → Bool`, because `1 == "a"` is safe Ruby returning
`false` and a rule requiring matching operand types would reject it for no semantic
reason. But writing `PrimSig σ "==" [τ] .bool` for *all* `σ` would be a rule no rung could
ever falsify: `σ` ranges over `Ty`, including `.any` (which also denotes a `BasicObject`)
and the arrow types. So the argument is unconstrained and the **receiver** carries a
six-constructor `EqSafe` side condition (`int`/`float`/`bool`/`nilT`/`sym`/`cls _`), each
naming a class that really does inherit or override a total `==`. `eqSafe?` is its
decidable twin, tied back by `eqSafe?_sound`.

This is the ladder's first *conditional* `PrimSig` row, and it changes `primSig?`'s shape:
the `==` arm is a guarded match (`if eqSafe? σ`) sitting **first** in the table, before the
receiver-keyed rows, since it is keyed on the method name and an arbitrary receiver.
`primSig?_sound` correspondingly grows a nested `split` for that arm; the remaining rows
are still discharged by one `injection`/`subst` and a `first | exact .row` list.

**Negative controls for the new rows.** Per the standing rule that confirming rungs pass
never shows a signature is too generous, six controls were added to `CheckRungs.lean`:
`1 < "a"`, `1.length`, `nil.zero?` (all three genuinely raise — sound rejections), and
`!nil`, `"a" < "b"`, `5.to_s(2)` (all three safe — conservative rejections, printed as
such). `1.zero?` was retired as a control because it is now a rung.

`PrimSig.objEq` deliberately has **no sound-rejection control**, and that is recorded in
`CheckRungs.lean` rather than papered over: `==` really is total on every receiver
`EqSafe` admits, so no neighbouring `==` program in this fragment raises. What constrains
the rule is `EqSafe`, and violating it requires a `Ty` (`.any`, an arrow) that no
expression in today's fragment synthesizes — so the control that would probe it cannot be
written yet. Worth revisiting at the rung that first synthesizes `.any`.

**Renames.** `Ratchet/Rungs13.lean` → `Ratchet/Rungs.lean`, `Check13.lean` →
`CheckRungs.lean`, the `check13` exe → `checkrungs`, `scripts/run_check13.sh` →
`scripts/run_check_rungs.sh`, `rungs13` → `rungs`, `validate_all_13` →
`validate_all_rungs`. The "13" was baked into five filenames and would have been wrong
after every clink. Done now, while the churn is small.

**`run_ratchet.sh` now runs `checkrungs` too**, between the agreement gate and the ladder,
so one command covers all three legs (agreement → evidence → ladder). The ladder's own
number stays a pure statement about `validate`; the evidence just prints above it.

State after this clink: **24 rungs climbed**, 24/24 cross-checked against the real
semantics, 12/12 negative controls rejected, 114/114 corpus agreement with CRuby,
`chk_sound`/`validate_sound_syntactic` axiom-clean (`propext`, `Quot.sound`).
