# Lean model — implementation notes (decisions L1–L12)

Non-critical choices, recorded for rollback per the workspace convention
(cf. `../harness/desugar-dt/implementation-choices.md` C1–C20,
`../difftest/implementation-notes.md` N1–N8). Load-bearing *semantics*
decisions live in the sketch and README, not here.

- **L1 — interpreter before `Step`.** The sketch names `inductive Step` the
  definition of record; we built `stepFn` first so the model could meet the
  difftest engine on day one (the sketch's own §4 argument). `Step` will be
  authored against `stepFn`, then the adequacy theorems.
- **L2 — heap = dense `Array Object`,** ObjId = index (not AssocList as
  sketched). O(1) get/set, allocation appends, ids never reused. Swap back
  behind the Heap interface if extensional proofs prefer AssocList.
- **L3 — frame store = `Array Frame`,** FrameId = index; stack is
  `List FrameId`. Matches the sketch's store/stack split; blocks (L1) will
  use `captured` chains into this store.
- **L4 — builtins keyed by string bid `"Owner#name"`,** registered in H₀
  method tables as `MethodDef` with `builtin := some bid`, so user defs
  shadow builtins through ordinary lookup. Alternative (closure table)
  rejected: strings keep `Boot` data-only and diff nicely.
- **L5 — lookup-miss trichotomy** (dispatch fidelity): (a) name exists in
  CRuby per generated tables (`CRubyNames.lean`) but unmodeled →
  `Unsupported`; (b) total miss with explicit receiver or args → real
  `NoMethodError`, byte-exact message; (c) bare implicit zero-arg send →
  `Unsupported` (RubyCore conflates vcall/fcall; their error classes
  differ). Same split for constants via `crubyToplevelConstants`.
- **L6 — shadow checks**: user-method resolution gates if CRuby defines the
  name on a class *between* receiver's class and the resolved owner
  (test_yjit_120's `String#getbyte` vs toplevel `def getbyte`). Class-object
  receivers additionally consult generated *singleton* name tables
  (`Hash.ruby2_keywords_hash`), except when our lookup resolved to a builtin
  (our class-aware `Class#new` subsumes the common singleton constructors).
- **L7 — `reprPure` flag**: a user `def` of to_s/inspect/==/eql?/message/
  to_str flips it; pure-repr consumers (`puts`, `p`, `String()`, `inspect`
  of containers) then answer `Unsupported` for plain objects/main rather
  than print a wrong default. Direct sends self-correct via lookup.
- **L8 — Float policy**: arithmetic modeled; any *rendering* of a Float
  (to_s/inspect/interpolation/final result) gates — Ruby requires
  shortest-roundtrip formatting, Lean's `Float.toString` is `%f`-style.
  Implementing Ryū-style output is a contained future work item.
- **L9 — `$!` model**: set on rescue entry (restored on handler exit to the
  value saved at entry) and during `ensure` bodies running for an in-flight
  raise (restored after). Not yet set during bare propagation through
  frames — unobservable at L0 (no reads outside rescue/ensure survive the
  fragment gate).
- **L10 — fuel**: default 5M steps; `RunResult.outOfFuel` is distinguished
  from `stuck` (sketch §5) and maps to `Unsupported "out of fuel"` at the
  SUT boundary (never a fake timeout).
- **L11 — `stuck` ≠ `Unsupported`**: a stuck machine exits 1 with a
  `MODEL STUCK (bug)` banner and the Python adapter prefixes `MODEL-BUG:` —
  never silently absorbed into the fragment gate.
- **L12 — zero-arg builtin arity list** (`zeroArgBids`): extra args to
  zero-arg builtins raise `ArgumentError … expected 0` (test_yjit_090);
  optional-arg builtins instead gate their with-arg forms individually.
- **L13 — metatheory PoC lives under `RubyCore/Proof/`, off the default
  target.** `Step.lean` (relation + `Step.sound`/`Step.deterministic`),
  `Adequacy.lean` (`Step.heap_monotone`, `Step.complete`, `Step.adequacy`),
  `Demo.lean` (`example`s: non-vacuity, a concrete 5-step reduction of `1;2`
  to the value `2`, adequacy on a real `init`). They are part of the
  `RubyCore` lib glob but *not* imported by `Main`, so `lake build` (the
  `rubycore` exe) never touches them; build with
  `lake build RubyCore.Proof.Adequacy RubyCore.Proof.Demo`. Rationale for the
  separation: this is a **proof of concept** — first evidence the interpreter-
  first architecture admits real theorems — and is expected to be reworked (or
  scrapped and re-derived) when L1/L2 change the machine shape, so it is kept
  physically apart from the SUT. Deps audited via `#print axioms`: only
  `propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound` (no `sorryAx`, no `native_decide`).
- **L14 — fragment is an effect-light *control core*, not full L0.** `Step`
  covers literals, `var`/`vasgn` (local/ivar/global — ivar with a `ref` self,
  always true at toplevel), `seq`, `if`, `while`, `break`/`next`, and jump
  propagation past neutral konts. Deliberately excluded (each is "no `Step`
  exists", matching `stepFn` → `.unsupported`/`.stuck`/`.done`): `send`/
  dispatch, `return` (needs a method frame from a send), `begin`/`rescue`/
  `ensure`, `class`/`module`/`def`, `const`/`casgn`, arrays/hashes, class
  variables, and the frozen-immediate `@x=` path. This is a proof-technique
  PoC, so fragment *membership* (`InFrag`) is narrow by design; the theorems
  quantify over all configs in it, not over whole real programs. Next
  extension is `send`: fold `invoke` (and `Builtins.run`) into the relation as
  a trusted oracle — `Step` gets a constructor `invoke … = .next m' → Step …`
  — so the dispatch machinery is proved adequate without re-proving the
  axiomatized builtin library. `return`/frames and `begin` unwinding follow.
- **L15 — proof-tactic choices** (revertable). *Soundness* is one uniform
  `cases h <;> simp_all […]` with a **full-unfold** simp set (`stepFn`,
  `evalExpr`, `applyKont`, `unwind`, `withCtl`/`withKont`, `pop`, the frame
  setters, `currentFrame`, `bindIvar`, `allocStr`/`Heap.alloc`): each
  constructor's image is *definitionally* what `stepFn` returns, so every case
  closes by reduction. Partial unfold desyncs the two sides (one keeps
  `pop m rest` folded while the other expands and rewrites `m.ctl` via the
  hypothesis) — unfold `pop` too or nothing. *`strLit`* inlines the
  `objs.push` allocation in the constructor rather than carrying a
  `allocStr m s = (v, m')` Prod equation, which `simp` handles far more
  cleanly. *Determinism* is a 3-line corollary of soundness + `.next`
  injectivity (`stepFn` is a function). *Completeness* uses the `realize`
  helper: name the constructor whose shape matches, and soundness + injectivity
  force its target to equal the executable's `m'` — so each case is
  `exact realize hs (.someCtor …)` after a structural `cases`.
